# Title

Fake News - From Data Collection to Classification

## Abstract


## Technical Details


## Open Source Development Experience

I enjoy and regularly contribute to open source scientific computing libraries. I was previously selected to participate in Google Summer of Code 2016 with Gensim under the NumFOCUS umbrella, where I implemented Dynamic Topic Models. My [blog](https://summerofcode2017.wordpress.com/) details my experiences during summer of 2016.

I have been using pymc3 for my research work at INRIA, and to learn probabilitic programming myself. I've recently started contributing to pymc3 - these are my [contrinutions](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3/issues?q=is%3Aopen+mentions%3Abhargavvader).

I'm still a regular contributor for [Gensim](https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/gensim/pulls/bhargavvader) - I have 29 pull requests merged, and actively help on the mailing list and issues. I have given talks at PyCon France 2016 and PyCon Slovakia 2017 about my experience with Gensim and GSoC 2016. I also contribute to [metric-learn](https://github.com/all-umass/metric-learn/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Abhargavvader+is%3Aclosed), [Edward](https://github.com/blei-lab/edward/pulls/bhargavvader), and [spaCy](https://github.com/explosion/spacy-notebooks/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Abhargavvader+is%3Aclosed). The links direct to my PRs/issues for the respective repos. My [GitHub profile](https://github.com/bhargavvader) has a more detailed summary of all my contributions. 


## Academic Experience

I am a student researcher at INRIA, France. I work with the MODAL (Models Of Data Analysis and Learning) team, where I work on Predictor Aggregation and Metric Learning problems. I'm finishing up my undergraduate education in Computer Science Engineering from BITS Pilani University, India. My [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0By80y9AXd1WsRUJWTlFfeldITGc/view?usp=sharing) details my previous internships and research experiences, which are all in the field of Machine Learning, Data Science and Software Engineering.
