# Title

Fake News - From Data Collection to Classification

## Abstract


## Technical Details


## Open Source Development Experience

I enjoy and regularly contribute to open source scientific computing libraries. I was previously selected to participate in Google Summer of Code 2016 with Gensim under the NumFOCUS umbrella, where I implemented Dynamic Topic Models. My [blog](https://summerofcode2017.wordpress.com/) details my experiences during summer of 2016.

I'm still a regular contributor for [Gensim](https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/gensim/pulls/bhargavvader) - I have 29 pull requests merged, and actively help on the mailing list and issues. I have given talks at PyCon France 2016 and PyCon Slovakia 2017 about my experience with Gensim and GSoC 2016. I also contribute to [metric-learn](https://github.com/all-umass/metric-learn/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Abhargavvader+is%3Aclosed), [Edward](https://github.com/blei-lab/edward/pulls/bhargavvader),[spaCy](https://github.com/explosion/spacy-notebooks/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Abhargavvader+is%3Aclosed), and [pymc3](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3/issues?q=is%3Aopen+mentions%3Abhargavvader. The links direct to my PRs/issues for the respective repos. My [GitHub profile](https://github.com/bhargavvader) has a more detailed summary of all my contributions. 


## Academic Experience

I am a student researcher at INRIA, France. I work with the MODAL (Models Of Data Analysis and Learning) team, where I work on Predictor Aggregation and Metric Learning problems. I'm finishing up my undergraduate education in Computer Science Engineering from BITS Pilani University, India. My [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0By80y9AXd1WsRUJWTlFfeldITGc/view?usp=sharing) details my previous internships and research experiences, which are all in the field of Machine Learning, Data Science and Software Engineering.

## Why this project? 

My interest in this project is for multiple reasons. While I majored in Computer Science at University, my minor was in Philosophy, Economics, Politics [PEP]. My coursework in the Social Sciences is what sparked my interest in Computational Social Science - solving or understanding social problems with the use of Computational tools. And Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Procsssing is a very powerful way to approach social problems, mainly because of the abundance of textual data and ways to mine them. The Fake News problem in particular is interesting because of how often we feel its affects, or notice it, or talk about it - with the ubiquity of social media, Fake News is everywhere! It directly affects our ruling governements and in some cases the policies - our ability to be informed voters is no longer easy. By making any progress in solving this problem - from gathering, labelling data and documentation to training a model - we are solving an important research and social problem.

A personal reason is my interest in pursuing a PhD in Computational Social Sciences - working with researchers from CLiPS, a top facility for Computational Linguistics would be a great research experience!

## What skills do I have suited for this project?

I have 3 years of experience in python, and have spent a considerable amount of time contributing to open source, particularly in python and machine learning. As I mentioned in the Open Source Development Experience section, I'm very comfortable with open source python NLP/CL tools. My background in the social sciences will also help in better analysing the context of the problem. 

My research experience in Machine Learning means I am familiar with the pipeline of solving such problems - finding and cleaning data, writing clean, reproducable code and keeping the process open source is as important as solving it. 

I have worked with visualisation tools such as D3.js before, and am very comfortable with matplotlib. This [link](https://github.com/bhargavvader/personal/tree/master/notebooks) contains all the Jupyter Notebooks I have made and contributed to.
